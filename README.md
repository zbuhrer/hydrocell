## Quantum Mechanical Simulation of Hydrogen-Based Energy Systems

HydroCell is a scientific simulation framework for modeling quantum mechanical behavior relevant to hydrogen-based energy systems, with a particular focus on electron tunneling across proton-permeable barriers in fuel cells and related technologies.

### Project Overview

This simulation suite explores the quantum mechanical foundations of hydrogen energy conversion processes, starting from first principles:

- Electron wavefunction modeling through the time-independent Schrödinger equation
- Quantum tunneling across potential barriers (proton exchange membranes)
- Bond formation simulations using orbital interactions and tight-binding approximations
- System-level variables integration (voltage, current, hydrogen pressure, catalytic effects)

### Mathematical Foundation

The core of HydroCell is based on solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation:

$$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi(x)}{dx^2} + V(x)\psi(x) = E\psi(x)$$

For tunneling problems, we analyze transmission probabilities through barriers as a function of:
- Barrier height and width
- Electron energy
- Effective mass

To simulate electron tunneling through a rectangular barrier:

```python
from sim.potentials import rectangular_barrier
from sim.solver import solve_schrodinger
from sim.visualization import plot_wavefunction

# Define potential barrier
params = {
    'barrier_height': 10.0,  # eV
    'barrier_width': 1.0,    # nm
    'electron_energy': 5.0   # eV
}

# Create potential function
V = rectangular_barrier(params)

# Solve Schrödinger equation
energy, psi = solve_schrodinger(V, params)

# Calculate tunneling probability
T = tunneling_probability(psi, params)

# Visualize results
plot_wavefunction(psi, V)
```
